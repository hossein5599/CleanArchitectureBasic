# CleanArchitectureBaseDotnetEight

 
Welcome to My Basic project focused on implementing Clean Architecture On Dotnet Lately 8 and various Design Patterns to create a robust and scalable application framework.

## Key Features:

- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation): Implementing CQRS to separate read and write operations, improving performance.
- Unit of Work: Utilizing the Unit of Work pattern and ensure data integrity across multiple operations.
- Repository Patterns: Establishing repository patterns for data access, a clean separation of concerns.
- Entity Framework Core: Integrating EF Core for efficient database interactions and ORM capabilities.
- Caching Support: Implementing caching mechanisms with Redis to enhance application performance and reduce database load.
- Custom Middleware: Developing custom middleware for error handling, logging, and request processing.
- Health Monitoring: Incorporating health checks and monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to ensure application reliability.
- API Management: Utilizing Swagger for API documentation and management,  with features like rate limiting, authentication (JWT tokens), and versioning.
- Load Balancing: Implementing load balancing strategies to distribute traffic effectively across services.
- Background Processing: Utilizing background processing techniques with tools like Hangfire and RabbitMQ for asynchronous task management.
- Error Handling: Creating custom exception handlers and enumerating list handlers for better error management.
- Data Encryption: Ensuring data security through encryption and decryption mechanisms.

This project is designed to build maintainable, testable, and scalable applications using  in software architecture.
